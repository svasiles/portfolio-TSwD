# The idea
## Project outline
The project will focus on the changes in diversity of artists included in European biennials in the past 15 years. This would serve to get an understanding of not just the artists that are included but also if the audience can have access to various cultures and points of view.

The story will be based on a data set of the artists that have showed in 15 biennials from Europe in the past 15 years. It will **start** with a short introduction into the issue of diversity in the arts and the important part biennials have as large visited events that are meant to show both outside and local artists. 

The **second part** with focus on the artists that have showed in these events comparing the shift in demographics (gender and location – place of birth or place where artist resides) since 2005. Statistics that could be included are related to category to category and mostly explaining the evolution. 

The **last part** will include the call to action. Thinking of the type of users for this project (individuals and organization working in contemporary visual arts as well as people interested in issues of diversity and culture in general) the call to action would be to focus more on organizations facilitating and supporting artists that aren’t present or underrepresented in current shows and for individuals(artists, curators, historians) to become aware of this and try to build a larger network outside their local one.

“As a reader, I want to **know how I am represented** so that I can **be more active and expand my network.”**

“As a reader, I want to **see the evolution over time** so that I can **become aware and advocate for diversity if needed.”**

“As a reader, I want to **see the success cases (events or countries)** so that I can **learn from them”**

## Initial sketches

First draft of story. While working on this draft, some limitations to the current structure of the data became apparent. For the second draft the data will be modified to include regions, instead of countries as the charts are hard to read when all the countries are introduced. Also, including descriptive statistics could help in showing more generalized trends.

## The data
The data includes the following: 
- name of event (15 biennials where used: Baltic Triennial; Berlin Biennial for Contemporary Art, Biennale de Lyon, Bucharest Biennial, Documenta, EVA International, GIBCA, Istanbul Biennial, Liverpool Biennial, Ljubljana Biennial, Manifesta, Moscow Biennial, October Salon, Thessaloniki Biennial, Venice Biennial) 
-	location of the event
-	year (2005-2020)
-	name of artist
-	country of the artists (some information was available for place of birth, some for the place where they living)
-	gender (male, female or neutral; for collectives and collaborations the gender was decided based on whether all members were the same gender, an if not, the gender assigned is neutral)

From the dataset I plan to highlight the following:
-	general statistics for categorical-categorial values for the current year; 
-	evolution over time: time-based charts in order to show the evolution over time (number of male artists vs female artists; country participation; region - Europe, America, Asia, Africa – participation; etc.)
-	evolution of time and space: maps to show the geographic diversity of artists, the geographic provenance of artists and where they are exhibited.

The dataset can be downloaded here.

## Method and medium

For the final project I plan to use Shorthand to create a narrative and display the data. 

The **first step** will be looking at the data and selecting the information I need for the time and geographic-based charts and graphs. From this I can create the first draft of the story arc to ask for feedback (whether the topic and framing of the topic is relevant, the information used if helpful) 

The **second step** will be creating wireframes and the storyboard. Working on both at the same time will help in making sure there is cohesion between the elements. This stage will also have a feedback aspect where the main question will be on the relevance of the charts and the overall story building up to the call for action.

The **third step** will be to create a final version in Shorthand focusing on whether the information can be easily read and understood. From the feedback received in the previous step, the presentation for the call for action should be easier to create, while making sure it’s cohesive with the presentation of the data.

For the **final presentation** I will present the main findings and highlight the connection to the call for action.

# Design and user research

The target audience People that work in the art world, especially contemporary art, but also individuals that are passionate about art and viewers interested in learning more about the art world.

## The feedback
### The choice 

For the feedback I started with my immediate circle identifying women and men that work in arts and cultures or want to work. I also considered people that are interested in the arts and consume arts at least once a year. For the interview I chose 3 people from my immediate circle of friends, colleagues, and acquaintances that I considered represented different types of audiences: a professional in the field, a student in the field, and an art consumer. For the project in general, I consider random surveys as not helpful, as the topic is limited to the discussion on gender equality in contemporary art, which is a niche subject.

The interview I emailed the 3 people selected the interview questions and a mock-up of the layout, which included some text, but not all. I considered this would allow them at least 15 minutes to look at the mock-up and answer the questions. After taking some time, they would fill in the questions and email them back to have as evidence. The last step was a 10-15 min conversation with the person interviewed to answer any questions they had or listen further remarks they had after the written interview.

**The questions** that were emailed for the interview are:

*What is the main idea you got from the image?*

*What point do you find confusing?*

*What charts or text do you find not convincing?*

*Do you think there is more to be added to the image that will convince you of the urgency?*

*What do you like about the story and what do you think it’s missing?*

*Through these questions my goal was to understand their perspective on the story and be able to have a brief conversation.*

This is the first mock-up that was sent with the questions

**The answers**

The feedback and the ideas from the conversations were put together and used for the second mock-up

These are the ideas from the feedback and conversations

## The revised mock-up

This is the revised mock-up created from the user research.

Concerns and further steps:

At this stage the third idea from the data is still not complete. More information from past research will be added to the findings. Further information for actions taken by cultural institutions to promote women artists will be added.

Thoughts on the user research:

The user research gave me an better perspective on what the project is lacking in terms of using the data, and also confirmed some of my own concerns on what wasn’t okay with the project It is a time consuming process, however it is very useful in completing the project. I would like to be able to use this through all the versions of the mock-up and the final project, if possible. There is the temptation to want to explain what the project is or how to read a certain graph, but it is more helpful to let user describe exactly what they see.

# Final data story

## Choosing the audience

The audience for this project was initially individuals and organizations that work in arts and culture, and students that wish to work in this field, as the call for action was intended for them. Also, the topic of contemporary art made me consider that only a small niche specialized in this field would be interested. The further research in the potential audience, didn’t lead to narrowing down the audience, but actually widening, by including art consumers, the individuals that have attended at least one exhibition in the past year, as well as other people who are interested in the arts in general, but not necessarily in the visual arts. 

Based on this audience I chose the three individuals to provide feedback: a female professional working for an art gallery, a female student learning about arts management and contemporary art, and a male IT programmer that has attended at least one art exhibition per year in the last 5 years. The feedback overlapped in some areas, which made me more confident in changing the layout or graphs. I paid special attention to the feedback on the things they found confusing (dips in graphs, use of maps, certain concepts that were new, etc.) rather than the way it looks, or the types of graphs used. The reason is that the final layout should be able to communicate clearly and be easily understood no matter the prior knowledge. 

Another aspect that I tried to address from the feedback, was the concern raised by one of the interviewees about what is the call for action for the audience. In my research I concluded that the responsibility was only of the institutions, curators, or gallery owner, but this made me think of how to shape the story that would compel an art consumer to go to attend more exhibitions by female artists or artists of color. The graphs that were made were the gender inequality index, which sets the art world in a global context, more easily relatable to the non-arts audience.

![Gender inequality map](/maps-03.png)

Further feedback after the part II assignment was limited due to time constraints, but the feedback received pointed to making the text clear and accessible even for those that have no connections with the visual arts, especially contemporary art. The changes for that were mostly included in the text. 

## The process of creating the final project

In making the final project in Shorthand, since I still had some parts of the narrative that were still unclear, working through the story and using the questions from the “Good Charts” book made the project advance more easily, especially since getting feedback on short notice was very hard. 

Another aspect, working with Shorthand and understanding the possibilities but also the limitations in displaying the graphs was a different way of working with the information I had. Throughout this step there were various changes to the layout and the graphs in order be easily read in Shorthand. One of the changes was the decision to keep just one image in the beginning and leave a lot of white space so that when scrolling the reader doesn’t get distracted.

In working on the final project, building the story also included adding elements to the dataset. Since this was a set that I made, it was easier to understand the data and what type of information would help me add depth to the story. As such, the final dataset also includes the Gender Inequality Index for each country and the curator and the gender of the curator for each exhibition. These additions helped in making the right visualization that would clearly show the idea I was presenting in the narrative. For example, the small differences between male and female curators in terms of selecting women artists showed that gender inequality also has to do with education and pressure to succeed.

![Curator chart](/graphs final_Artboard 8.png)

There were two changes I made after working on the presentation and the feedback from it. One reminded me that the information could show inequality at a more granular level, not just overall trends, and the other made me more aware of how interconnected visual arts are and how the call to action is a joint effort by all those involved. And so, the one of the last graphs added was to show difference in male and female artists based on the number of times each artist has been in one of the exhibitions. What I considered was that participation in these events meant that the more events the more successful the artists, which shows some information at the individual level. The other was a small diagram of the different individuals and organizations in the art world and how they can influence the visibility of artists.

**Extra information**

There is one information that was important to mention, and that was the way the dataset was made. The data set was created from biennial catalogues and artfacts.net, where information of the name of the artist, country of origin, gender, and age were extracted. In the first phase approximately 4000 out of 6300 artists had the all the complete information needed. The rest of the information was found using google search, but since the age was missing from a third of the artists and was the hardest to find, I decided to not use it in the final set. As such, by eliminating age, only 1000 artists were missing the country of origin and gender. Finding this information was done using online searches and other websites like mutualart.com and artilinkart.com (a Chinese website that has an artist database).
