## Part Two
The target audience:people that work in the art world, especially contemporary art, but also individuals that are passionate about art and viewers interested in learning more about the art world.

b.i start with my imediate circle identifying women and men that work in the art world, or want to work, and in general individuals that work in arts and culture. I also look for people that are interested in the arts and consume arts at least once during a year. From my imediate circle the best chances for such an interview are through those identified as potential interviees from the imediate circle of friends, aquaintances, and former colegues. Random surveys would not help much as the topic is limiting the discussion on gender equlity to contemporary art.

c. Emailed interview questions and draft to interviees. In order to give them at least 10-15 min to read throught the image. After, they would fill in the questions and send those back. A short 10 min conversation would follow after if the person interviewed would have further questions or remarks.

these are the questions:
What is the main idea you got from the image?
What point do you find confusing?
What charts or text do you find not convincing? 
Do you think there is more to be added to the image that will convince you of the urgency?
What do you like about the story and what do you think it's missing?
