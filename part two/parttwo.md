# Part Two
**The target audience**
People that work in the art world, especially contemporary art, but also individuals that are passionate about art and viewers interested in learning more about the art world.

## The feedback
**The choice**
For the feedback I started with my imediate circle identifying women and men that work in arts and cultures, or want to work. I also considered people that are interested in the arts and consume arts at least once a year. For the interview I chose 3 people from my imediate circle of friends, colegues, and aquaintances that I considered represented different types of audiences: a professional in the field, a student in the field, and an art consumer. For the project in general, I consider random surveys as not helpful, as the topic is is limited to the discussion on gender equlity in contemporary art, which is a niche subject.

**The interview**
I emailed the 3 people selected the interview questions and a mock-up of the layout, which included some text, but not all. I considered this would allow them at least 15 minutes to look at the mock-up and andwer the questions. After taking some time, they would fill in the questions and email them back to have as evidence. The last step was a 10-15 min conversation with the person interviewed to answer any questions they had or listen further remarks they had after the written interview.

The questions that were emailed for the interview are:

  *What is the main idea you got from the image?*
  
  *What point do you find confusing?*
  
  *What charts or text do you find not convincing?*
  
  *Do you think there is more to be added to the image that will convince you of the urgency?*
  
  *What do you like about the story and what do you think it's missing?*

Through these questions my goal was to understand their perspective on the story and be able to have a brief conversation.

**This is the first mock-up that was sent with the questions**

**The answers**
The feedback and the ideas from the conversations were put together and used for the second mock-up

These are the ideas from the feedback and conversations

*Concerns and further steps:*
At this stage the third idea from the data is still not complete.
More information from past research will be added to the findings.

*Thoughts on the user research:*
The user research gave me an better perspective on what the project is lacking in terms of using the data, and also confirmed some of my own concerns on what wasn't okay with the project
It is a time consuming process, however it is very useful in completing the project. I would like to be able to use this through all the versions of the mock-up and the final project, if possible.
There is the temptation to want to explain what the project is or how to read a certain graph, but it is more helpful to let user describe exactely what they see.
