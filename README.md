# About me
Hi! My name is Silvia, I'm a MAM exchange student from the University of Bologna. Before school, I worked in the visual arts and creative industries. After graduation, I want to keep doing that but use all this new knowledge from school to have a bigger positive impact.

# What I hope to learn
*Unbias, aesthetically pleasing, easy to read,* and *convincing* way to visualize data. With the help of my drafting skills I hope to learn as much as I can on data visualization.
