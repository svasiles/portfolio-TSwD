# About me
Hi! My name is Silvia. I'm a MAM exchange student from the University of Bologna. Before school, I worked in the visual arts and creative industries. After graduation, I wasn to keep doing that, but use all this new Knowledge from school to have a bigger positive impact.

# What I hope to learn

Unbias, aesthetically pleasant, easy to read, and convincing way to vizualize data. With the help of my drafting skills I hope to learn as much as I can on data visualization.
