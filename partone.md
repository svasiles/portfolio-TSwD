# Part one of final project

## Project outline
The project will focus on the changes in diversity of artists included in European biennials in the past 15 years. This would serve to get an understanding of not just the artists that are included but also if the audience can have access to various cultures and points of view.
The story will be based on a data set of the artists that have showed in 15 biennials from Europe in the past 15 years.  It will start with a short introduction into the issue of diversity in the arts and the important part biennials have as large visited events that are meant to show both outside and local artists. 
The second part with focus on the artists that have showed in these events comparing the shift in demographics (gender and location – place of birth or place where artist resides) since 2005. Statistics that could be included are related to category to category and mostly explaining the evolution. 
The last part will include the call to action. Thinking of the type of users for this project (individuals and organization working in contemporary visual arts as well as people interested in issues of diversity and culture in general) the call to action would be to focus more on organizations facilitating and supporting artists that aren’t present or underrepresented in current shows and for individuals(artists, curators, historians) to become aware of this and try to build a larger network outside their local one.
“As a reader, I want to **know how I am represented** so that I can **be more active and expand my network.”**
“As a reader, I want to **see the evolution over time** so that I can **become aware and advocate for diversity if needed.”**
“As a reader, I want to **see the success cases (events or countries)** so that I can **learn from them”**

## Initial sketches
First draft of story. While working on this draft, some limitations to the current structure of the data became apparent. For the second draft the data will be modified to include regions, instead of countries as the charts are hard to read when all the countries are introduced. Also, including descriptive statistics could help in showing more generalized trends.

## The data
The data set includes the following: 
-	name of event (15 biennials where used: Baltic Triennial; Berlin Biennial for Contemporary Art, Biennale de Lyon, Bucharest Biennial, Documenta, EVA International, GIBCA, Istanbul Biennial, Liverpool Biennial, Ljubljana Biennial, Manifesta, Moscow Biennial, October Salon, Thessaloniki Biennial, Venice Biennial) 
-	location of the event
-	year (2005-2020)
-	name of artist
-	country of the artists (some information was available for place of birth, some for the place where they living)
-	gender (male, female or neutral; for collectives and collaborations the gender was decided based on whether all members were the same gender, an if not, the gender assigned is neutral)
From the dataset I plan to highlight the following:
-	general statistics for categorical-categorial values for the current year; 
-	evolution over time: time-based charts in order to show the evolution over time (number of male artists vs female artists; country participation; region - Europe, America, Asia, Africa – participation; etc.)
-	evolution of time and space: maps to show the geographic diversity of artists, the geographic provenance of artists and where they are exhibited.

## Method and medium
For the final project I plan to use Shorthand to create a narrative and display the data. 
The first step will be looking at the data and selecting the information I need for the time and geographic-based charts and graphs. From this I can create the first draft of the story arc to ask for feedback (whether the topic and framing of the topic is relevant, the information used if helpful) 
The second step will be creating wireframes and the storyboard. Working on both at the same time will help in making sure there is cohesion between the elements. This stage will also have a feedback aspect where the main question will be on the relevance of the charts and the overall story building up to the call for action.
The third step will be to create a final version in Shorthand focusing on whether the information can be easily read and understood. From the feedback received in the previous step, the presentation for the call for action should be easier to create, while making sure it’s cohesive with the presentation of the data.
For the final presentation I will present the main findings and highlight the connection to the call for action.
