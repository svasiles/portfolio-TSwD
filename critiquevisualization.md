I chose this data visualization because I see it a lot in art market reports and it always takes me some time to read the information. The information itself is very useful for anyone interested in this topic, and I've never seen a version that simplifies things, most times its separate visualizations for auction turnover and the number of lots sold.

## Data visualization

From the critique method using the 7 criteria it became clearer the things that worked and that didnâ€™t in terms of how the visualization was read not just by me, but by the intended audience. One thing that I notice was that it made me consider the changes I would make from the smallest change, like font size, to whether there is another type of visualization that can convey the information better. Because the graph for the 7 criteria was easier to remember with each change that I would consider I would always have in mind the graph and how my change could impact the other areas. But the main benefit of the critique method was considering the audience in relation to the information, not just the infographic. Establishing that the right information was shown and nothing more or less than needed is a very important step.

For wireframes, I started with a couple of very simple, fast sketches, and then recreated the elements from the initial graph in Illustrator as my wireframe. The process was more organic than I thought it would be, instead of doing a mix and match of elements, the critique method made me aware of the informative function of the visualization. As such, the wireframe was more of an evolution from the initial visualization to adding, moving, or taking out information until the title matched the visualization. The feedback was also helpful, understanding not just if people can read this, but also, because they were looking at different versions of it done during the wireframe step, they helped identified information that I might have edited out but should bring back into the graph. Adding just the amounts for the high values in the auction turnover was one of the conclusions from the feedback.

**These are the 4 versions of the wireframe made with Illustrator that were used for feedback**

For the redesign I decided to follow the information in the title, as I realized there was a slight disconnect between what I was reading in the graph and the title. So, the focus became the lots sold and not the comparison or relationship of the lots sold and auction turnover, as I initially interpreted the visualization. The final visualization shows the progression of the lots sold from 2000 to 2018, with the auction turnover in gray behind it. This was a version I designed during the wireframe part, and after the feedback I added some numbers for the peaks in auction turnover. This small change gave more perspective on the numbers for the lots sold. My attempt was to focus on the lots sold as the title suggested, but contextualize the trend in regard to auction turnover, as the two together have the ability to show a more complex and real image of the art market, as opposed to each element on its own. This change would add to the truthfulness of the visualization.
